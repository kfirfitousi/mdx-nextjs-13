### **This is a Proof-of-Concept for an MDX Blog built with Next.js 13, TypeScript and next-mdx-remote. You can read about it on my [blog](https://blog.kfirfitousi.com/web-dev/mdx-nextjs-13).**

This is a very minimal example, but it should give you a good idea of how to get started with MDX and Next.js 13.

- [x] Only 1 dependency added (next-mdx-remote)
- [x] Parsing frontmatter
- [x] Custom components
