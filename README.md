### **This is a Proof-of-Concept for rendering MDX files using Next.js 13, next-mdx-remote, and TypeScript. You can read more about it on my [blog](https://blog.kfirfitousi.com/posts/web-dev/mdx-nextjs-13).**

This is a very minimal example, but it should give you a good idea of how to get started with next-mdx-remote and Next.js 13.

- [x] Using Next.js 13's `/app` directory
- [x] Parsing frontmatter
- [x] Custom components

For additional reference, check out [this repo](https://github.com/kfirfitousi/blog) which is a full MDX blog built with Next.js 13.
